1,Alive in Wonderland,"Tim Burton’s“Alice in Wonderland” was probably the most anticipated movie of the year 2010. But is it any good? First of all, I should probably mention that hardcore Lewis Carroll fans may find very disappointing. The movie is merely based on the book. It features most of the same characters and a couple of the same locations, but the story is completely different. Alice is no longer a little girl, but an unconventional young woman who has the same dream of finding herself in Wonderland every night, until one day it happens in real life. Her arrival was expected. Alice is supposed to save the inhabitants from the evil Red Queen and get the reign back to her kind sister, the White Queen. She knows nothing about it, but she is meant to be the knight in shining armor, both figuratively and literally speaking.",,
2,A Beautifil Mind,"Beautiful Mind is a biographical movie about John Forbes Nash junior, mathematical genius with hard fate. At the beginning of his career he has made enormous contribution in the field of Game Theory, which was a revolution in this mathematical area and almost brought international fame to the author. The movie was filmed in 2001 by Ron Howard and today it is called modern classics: a true drama, making you think and evoking emotions.","Such movies, telling us about the life of a famous person, are always difficult to assess, because any such creations somehow pretend to be biographical ones. But in fact they are just a glance of one particular producer on the life of another individual. Of course, much depends on the actor who will perform the role of the protagonist and after watching Beautiful Mind I will agree with this once again.",
3,Wanted,The well-known Universal Studios film company had a plan to shoot a movie “Wanted” in 2004. The eponymous comic book by Mark Millar was picked up for the film`s plot. Company’s management wanted to make a hard film with a rating of “hard-R”.,"The atmosphere of comics entirely suited to these requirements. There was only one problem in the creation of the film – the choice of director. After a long search, the selection was made in favor of Timur Bekmambetov. This movie was his first job, but he fully met the expectations of the organizers. “Wanted” appeared on the world screens in 2008. This picture shows a totally new approach to the formulation of a hard fighter. The film has turned out to be quite criminal, dirty, with elements of a thriller.",
4,Sherlock Holmes,"Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law tried to embody unforgettable images of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson in this bold new film version. In G. Ritchie’s “Sherlock Holmes” the legendary detective shows not only his unmatched intelligence, but also considerable physical training as well.","Entangled evidence, amazing deduction of Holmes and his lively mind combine into an exciting series of grueling events. The director Guy Ritchie represents a fascinating adaptation of one of the world’s best detectives. Meet the new Sherlock Holmes!","The plot is as follows: Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) is rather depressed because of the possibility of Watson’s (Jude Law) marriage. His mood is also compounded by the absence of interesting cases. Trying to relax, he invents a silencer, does not go out of his room, participates in fights without rules and plays violin."

5,Kites,"“Kites” is not a traditional Indian movie, but rather a breath-taking action. This film is a romantic love story of an Indian guy Gee (Bollywood star Rithik Roshan) and a Mexican girl Natasha (Barbara Mori). They fell in love at first sight, despite the fact that she did not understand Hindi and speaks only Spanish, while he could speak only Hindi and English. Besides, Natasha was already engaged to another man. However, there are no barriers for true love.","This story is very exciting. Moreover, it is accompanied by highly dynamic and romantic scenes, many of which are not devoid of humor. In the Mexican desert a mortally wounded man is left to die under the rays of extremely hot desert sun. This is Gee, once a carefree young man, and now the person who is being searched for by the police.",
